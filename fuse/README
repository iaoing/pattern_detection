You should be able to figure out how to run it
by looking at 'make mount' which runs it in the
foreground and 'make smount' which runs it as a
daemon.  You'll need to edit the paths to the 
front end (where apps access PLFS files) and to
the back end (where PLFS actually stores files)
or you can set PLFS_MNT and PLFS_BACK environment
variables.

Also, you can pass a comma-separated list of 
back ends if you want PLFS to distribute directory
contents across multiple directories (e.g. to
distribute laod across metadata servers).

Finally, I sometimes forget to put -o direct_io
in the args to plfs.  This is very important
for performance.  Read more in the Makefile.
