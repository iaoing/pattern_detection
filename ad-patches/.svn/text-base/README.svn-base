for openmpi

I think you need these versions in your path =
(http://www.open-mpi.org/svn/building.php):
m4       1.4.14
autoconf 2.65
automake 1.11.1
libtool  2.2.6b

this assumes the plfs .so  is in /tmp/plfs/1.0.0/lib and autotools .so =
are in /tmp/autotools/lib.  you can change trunk to versions/1.0.0 if =
you want to work from 1.0.0 release

    wget =
